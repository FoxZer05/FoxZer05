#This is the first line of code that I learned
print("Hello World!")
print("____________")
#I added the second line afterwards just cuz :)

#Now for a little tomfoolery
print("Now I am just messing around with the 'print' input!")
print("I like chicken alfredo!")
#All that does is basically copy and paste whatever is in the string between the ""s in the ()s

#I also learned that you can assign a value to basically any variable
#For example
net_worth = 500000
bill = 10000

print(net_worth - bill)
#This just subtract 10000 from 500000 and spits out the total "490000"
#Learned most of all this from a mix of "Khan Academy" and a "Python for Dummies"
#What should I start to learn first so I can get into making games?
